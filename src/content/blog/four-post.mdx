# An h1 header

Paragraphs are separated by a blank line.

<TagSelector />

Note that --- not considering the asterisk --- the actual text
content starts at 4-columns in.

## An h2 header

Here's a numbered list:



(which makes copying & pasting easier). You can optionally mark the
delimited block for Pandoc to syntax highlight it:



### An h3 header

Now a nested list:

1.  First, get these ingredients:

    - carrots
    - celery
    - lentils

2.  Boil some water.

3.  Dump everything in the pot and follow
    this algorithm:

        find wooden spoon
        uncover pot
        stir
        cover pot
        balance wooden spoon precariously on pot handle
        wait 10 minutes
        goto first step (or shut off burner when done)

    Do not bump wooden spoon or it will fall.

Notice again how text always lines up on 4-space indents (including
that last line which continues item 3 above).
